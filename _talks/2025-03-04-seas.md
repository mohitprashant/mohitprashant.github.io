Presented a guest lecture at UPenn, SEAS on efficient scaling of RL systems such that the sample-complexity of learning is a linear function
of state-space size using localized MDP approximations, improving on SOTA log-linear scaling bounds. The full paper is available [here](https://mohitprashant.github.io/publications/).
